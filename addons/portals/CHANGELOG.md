# 1.0.0

First public release! This plugin was developed as part of my master's thesis. As such, the thesis 
itself is the best documentation at the moment:
[https://is.muni.cz/th/ydltb](https://is.muni.cz/th/ydltb/?lang=en). 

Also check out the included README.md for tips and potentially also the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/VojtaStruhar/godot-portals-plugin)
for some showcase levels.
